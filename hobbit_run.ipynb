    "This program is motivated by the ticking off an item on my bucket list, the rewriting of a favourite game. Almost 40 years ago, I bought a Commodore 64 (C64), but I had limited software development tools on it. I did have access to a cross assembler on a Digital DEC10, so I wrote a version of this game using the cross assembler for a 6502 CPU and downloaded it on a very slow modem (300 BAUD) to my C64. With the software tools in hand on my PC, I have now been able to write a much more concise version with more features than the original. In particular, the sprite collision code in [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) simplified the coding by quite a bit.\n",
